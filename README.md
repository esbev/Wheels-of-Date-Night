## Description

Wheels of Date Night provide a user-friendly experience to quickly get unique options for food and movies as viable date night ideas. The application is easy and fun to use. Simply click the spin button and the fun begins. 

Two wheels are presented and once the spin button is clicked, both will randomly rotate to pick a food cuisine and movie genre. When the wheels come to a stop, a pointer will indicate to the user which choice each wheel has chosen.

Below the wheels, the user is presented with 5 food options from the cuisine type and 5 movies from the genre list. The user only needs to choose a dish and a movie from the options and click the accept button. Doing so will save the user's input then list the 2 choices combined as a previous date. 

The option to clear previous food and movie lists is available by use of the clear button below. All previously saved dates will auto populate in the “Dating History" when the user returns to the app. 

You just took a simple dinner and a movie and made it exciting. Good luck and enjoy your date.

- ### Motivation/Development

    - #### One-minute-pitch

            Everyone has their favorite comfort food, their go-to cooking recipes, their regular restaurants, and even their favorite items on a menu that they choose every single time.

            They also have their regular TV shows, binging the same show over and over to the point where you know the script by heart. Movies wouldn’t just be a one time experience, but a WEEKLY routine. We are creatures of habit and unfortunately date nights are not immune to these familiar feelings of excitement becoming commonplace and bland.

            But nevertheless, you find yourself again on an evening alone with your significant other with no big plans for an exciting date. It looks like you’re just going to have to settle for another thoughtless, monotonous, boring, and tasteless "Dinner and a Movie”.

            We take the thoughtless and think for you.

            We take the monotonous and add color.

            We take the boring and bring excitement.

            We take the tasteless and spice it up.

            If you want to plan an elaborate date night, then we suggest you plan ahead. But if you don't have the time for that, then let us take the worry out of the situation.

            Our collaborative project has brought us to solve a problem that a lot of people experience. We propose a solution; through discovering a new dish and enjoying a potential hidden gem of a film, we have created:

            “Wheels of Date Night!”

- ## Technologies Used

    - ### Spoonacular API 
    - ### themoviedb API
    - ### Materialize CSS

- ## Future Development

    - ### By taking in latitude and longitude of the user’s current location, we could expand our food location options to include local restaurants and theaters based on the dish and movie selected.
 
    - ### Yelp API would be a beneficial addition to the application by not only providing the location but also reviews. Local businesses with games and leisurely activities like sports, museums, and music performances are awesome date night ideas. For future development, we could include parameters for events happening locally within your area like festivals, painting, and other group-oriented happenings.

## Description

Wheels of Date Night provides a user friendly way to quickly get new ideas for food and movies for any style of date. Wheels of Date Night is easy and fun to use; the user needs to simply click the spin button and the fun begins. Two wheels are presented and once the spin button is clicked the wheels will spin. One wheel has food cuisines and the other wheel has film genres. Once the wheels come to a stop there is an indicator to show the user what each wheel has chosen. Below the wheels are 5 dishes and 5 movies generated in a list for the user to choose from. The user only needs to choose a dish and a movie from the lists and click the save button. This will save the user's choices then list the combination in date history. The food and movie lists will get cleared and the wheels are ready for another spin if the user desires. All previously saved dates will auto populate in the "dating history" on user return to the site. You just took a simple dinner and a movie and made it exciting. Good luck and enjoy your date.

## Concept

- ### User Story

        AS A romantic couple
        I WANT to get unique ideas for dinner and a movie
        SO THAT I can plan a quick and spontaneous date night
        GIVEN a pair of spinner wheels and a spin button

- ### Acceptance Criteria

        WHEN I click on the spin button
        THEN I am presented with two spinning wheels
        WHEN I view the wheels stop
        THEN I am presented with a random cuisine type and a random film genre
        WHEN I am presented with a random cuisine type and a random film genre
        THEN I am automatically presented with 5 random dishes from the cuisine type and 5 random movies from the film genre
        WHEN I click on a dish and a movie
        THEN I am presented with a save button
        WHEN I click the save button
        THEN I am presented with a list of saved date nights with my food and movie selections, and the dish and movie lists clear
        WHEN I comeback to the page
        THEN I can view all previously saved date nights

- ### Motivation and Development

    - #### Motivation / One-minute-pitch

            Everyone has their comfort food, their regular dishes they cook, their regular restaurants, their favorite items on a menu they choose every single time, their regular TV shows, their regular channels they watch, those same old movies they watch again and again and again. Unfortunately date nights are not immune to these default parameters as well.

            But nevertheless you find yourself again with a evening alone with your signifcant other but you don't have time to plan a big date. So it looks like your going to have to settle for another thoughtless, monotonous, boring, tasteless "Dinner and a Movie."

            We take the thoughtless and think for you.

            We take the monotonous and add color.

            We take the boring and bring excitement.

            We take the tasteless and spice it up.

            If you want to plan an elaborate date night, then we suggest you plan ahead. But if you don't have time for that, then let us take you and your significant other to the "Wheels of Date Night."


## Process

- ### Technologies Used

- ### Tasks

- ### Challenges Encountered

    - #### Food API

    - #### Wheel value capture

- ### Successes in Development

## Future Development

In future development we can expand the choices of cuisines and genres presented. We can blend cuisines and blend genres to get even more narrowed choices for food and movies.

We could use geolocation to add the user's current location to present local restaurants based on the dish selected, and local theaters playing the movie selected.

Bring in more APIs to add parameters to the spontaneous date night experience. Such as local businesses with games, action oriented activities like wall climbing, go-kart racing, etc. We could include parameters for events happening locally like festivals, wine tasting, music events, sports games, etc.
